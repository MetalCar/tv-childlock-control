# tv-childlock-control

This little tool is for my son. I found out, that he silently go away from his bed in the middle of the night to watch tv.
So I decided to write a little tool that will turn the tv off when a configured contingent is achieved.
Additionally I want to specify times when the tv can be turned on. For us parents,
i will add a webadministration, where we can disable the childlock, that we are able to watch tv without contingent.
